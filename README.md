# Handins from Applied Optimization: Location Planning

This repository is dedicated to the code and results from the exercises presented in the course Applied Optimization: Location Planning in fall 2022 at the Department of Math at Aarhus University.

## Handin 1
In the folder ```h1``` one can find everything pertaining to the first handin. This exercise is based on a problem from the Danish Ministry of Defense regarding placement of drone stations.
The subfolder ```code``` contains all of the code, while ```maps``` contains the resulting maps from the solutions using the python module ```folium```. Finally ```plots``` contains some plots of the resulting key values from the best solutions we found.


This repository was created by Jens Trolle, Maria Askholm Nielsen and Nikolaj Kjær-Sørensen.
